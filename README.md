# A Framework for a Recommender System on Data-Centric Public Service Provision Using Large Language Models

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains the research paper and supporting materials for:
***A Framework for a Recommender System on Data-Centric Public Service Provision Using Large Language Models***.

The work explores how **Large Language Models (LLMs)** can be leveraged to design and implement recommender systems that enhance **data-driven public service delivery**. The framework addresses challenges of scalability, transparency, and trustworthiness in AI-assisted decision-making for public sector contexts.
