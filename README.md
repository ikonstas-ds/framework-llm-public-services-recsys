## üîç Abstract

> Over the last years, public service provision has been limited to document-centric procedures that require citizens to submit the same documents multiple times, which is time-consuming and error-prone. This study tackles this problem and proposes a data-centric framework for a recommender system that combines knowledge graphs (KGs) and large language models (LLMs) as a neuro-symbolic AI architecture. The framework expresses public service preconditions as machine-readable rules based on data standards and provides dynamic recommendations to citizen profiles through automated reasoning. LLMs are utilized to extract preconditions from unstructured textual regulations and create RDF-based evidence models, while KGs provide validation of preconditions through SHACL rules and explainable reasoning towards semantic interoperability. A use case on students applying for housing allowance showcases the feasibility of the proposed framework. The analysis indicates that combining KGs with LLMs for public service recommendations can improve the quality of public services and reduce administrative burdens towards a proactive ‚ÄúNo-Stop Government‚Äù, where services are recommended without explicit requests. The findings highlight the promising potential of employing neuro-symbolic AI to transform e-government processes, while also addressing challenges related to legal complexity, privacy and data fragmentation for large-scale adoption.
